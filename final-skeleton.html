        <p>Noise-regulation systems already in place are extremely advanced at recording real time data of noise levels, they almost solely focus only on the collection of the data, leaving the rest up to the DEP. Whilst this remedies the issue to a certain extent, the turnaround time can be slow, short-lasting and overall unhelpful to citizens a majority of the time*. Considering the powerful IoT systems already in place that collect real time data about noise in NYC, there should be a solution that parallels this constant influx of useful data.</p>
